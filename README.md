# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of Project

For this project, we are helping a business owner decide the location of his new Surf Shop that sells surfboards and ice cream. We want the location to have ideal weather for selling surfboards and ice cream and therefore we analyzed weather data. We also wanted to make sure that the weather was warm enough to sell these items all year round so we described the summary statistics for the temperatures in June and December.

## Results

The following images show the summary statistics for June and December, respectively.

As we can see, the mean temperature in June is 74 while the mean temperature in December is 71. We can make the following conclusions:
* The standard deviation is slightly higher in December than in June.
* The minimum temperature is 8 degrees colder in December, but the maximum temperature is only 2 degrees colder.
* All temperatures are above 56 degrees and are relatively close to each other

## Summary

After reviewing these results, we can see that this location is a good spot to open a surf shop that sells ice cream as well. Although it may be chilly on some days out of the year, there is a good chance that the weather stays in the 70â€™s all year long. We would recommend selling an additional item that is more ideal for the colder weather on some days as a specialty limited edition item. That way, the shop can still attract visitors and make profits even if the weather dips below 70 degrees. 

### Additional Queries

We could query other locations that are not in Hawaii. This will give us more data to analyze and maybe there are better locations for surf shops elsewhere. Another query we could perform is expanding the dates that we are collecting data from. Instead of focusing on the past few years or so, we could look at historical data to see if the climate is warming or cooling down. We also could look at tropical storms and determine if the location is prone to storms which could affect sales.
